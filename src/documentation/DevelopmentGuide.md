# Development Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for developers working on the phpStack Template System. It covers project setup, code structure, development workflow, testing, debugging, performance optimization, security considerations, and deployment.

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phpStack/template-system.git
   cd template-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use Composer to install project dependencies.
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Ensure your PHP environment meets the requirements (PHP 7.4 or higher).
   - Configure your web server to serve the PHP files.

## Code Structure

- **src/Core**: Contains the core components of the template system, including the template engine, component library, and plugin manager.
- **src/Plugins**: Houses custom plugins that extend the system's functionality.
- **src/Documentation**: Contains documentation files, including guides and API references.
- **Examples**: Provides practical examples demonstrating various features of the system.

## Development Workflow

- **Branching**: Use feature branches for new features and bug fixes.
- **Commits**: Write clear and concise commit messages.
- **Pull Requests**: Submit pull requests for code reviews before merging changes.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
- **Run Tests**: Use PHPUnit to run tests.
  ```bash
  ./vendor/bin/phpunit
  ```

## Debugging

- **Error Logs**: Check error logs for debugging information.
- **Debugging Tools**: Use tools like Xdebug for step-by-step debugging.

## Performance Optimization

- **Profiling**: Use the PerformanceProfiler class to monitor rendering times.
- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies to improve performance.

## Security Considerations

- **Sandboxing**: Use the PluginSandbox class to execute plugins in a controlled environment.
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## Deployment

- **Environment Configuration**: Configure environment variables for production.
- **Server Setup**: Ensure the server is configured for optimal performance and security.

For more detailed information, refer to the [API Documentation](ComposerAPI.md) and other documentation files in the `src/documentation` directory.
